## 🌌 About Me

Hey, I’m **cyberjob001** — architecting global enterprise infra, automating everything, running a home lab empire, and creating content, all while keeping my anime blog and YouTube channel alive!  
With **18+ years** of hands-on experience (and honestly, 20+ if you count the stuff I started breaking and fixing as a kid), I thrive in the intersection of code, infrastructure, content, and curiosity.  
If it’s tech, I do it. If it’s new, I’m testing it. If it’s creative, I’m building it.

- **AI/ML/LLMs:** Building pipelines, integrating AI into real projects, experimenting with new tech

---

## 🕵️ Reverse Engineering & Security

- **Reverse Engineering:** APIs (YouTube cipher, more), web/desktop apps (dnSpy, x64dbg, Burp Suite, browser DevTools, Fiddler)
- **Security:** Built robust, custom authentication (JWT, OAuth, SSO, Keycloak, AD, LDAP, 2FA), encryption, threat monitoring, and security-first infra design
- **API hacking and automation:** Built secure, scalable integrations; bypassed obfuscation and protection for research and learning
