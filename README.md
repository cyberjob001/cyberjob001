## 👋 About Me

I'm a **strategic network deployment leader** with 18+ years of hands-on experience delivering enterprise-scale infrastructure projects across the Americas. I thrive at the intersection of technology, operations, and business—enabling high-impact network transformations, pioneering automation, and driving process innovation with a no-code/low-code mindset.

- 🌎 **Global Impact:** Led deployments in the US, Canada, Mexico, and Brazil for industry giants in finance, telecom, and beyond.
- 👥 **Team Builder:** Managed, mentored, and empowered engineers across regions—delivering on ambitious goals with quality and consistency.
- 🤝 **Cross-Functional Collaborator:** Bridged the gap between engineering, security, vendors, and business teams to deliver results at scale.
- 💡 **Change Catalyst:** Passionate about eliminating friction, automating workflows, and creating documentation that actually helps.
- 🛠️ **Stack Explorer:** From Cisco ACI/Arista CVP to ServiceNow, JIRA, and DIY automation—if it improves delivery, I’m on it.

## ⚡ What I Do Best

- **Network Architecture & Deployment:** End-to-end project leadership, from design to go-live and decommissioning.
- **Change Management:** Orchestrating seamless, compliant, and risk-aware delivery across multiple environments.
- **Automation Advocate:** Bringing no-code/low-code solutions (hello, Zapier & Make!) to legacy processes for faster, better results.
- **Documentation & Enablement:** Crafting guidelines, playbooks, and standards for global teams.
- **Mentoring & Problem-Solving:** The go-to escalation point for complex deployments and process challenges.
